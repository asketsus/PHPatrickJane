#PHPatrickJane
PHPatrickJane is a PHP-Cli project it helped me to get certified as PHP Certified Engineer. Its functionality is to ask the name of all existing functions within a category. In each round the right answers will be deleted and we will have an overview of our faults. The program will ask us faulty functions those who have no right in the previous round.

The logic of this program is to exercise the memorization to answer those less remembered.
